Exception handling itself is implemented in Codon using the Itanium C++ ABI for zero-cost exceptions, along with LLVM's exception handling instructions: (<code>landingpad</code>, <code>resume</code>, <code>invoke</code>) and specialized personality function. There is additional bookkeeping required for knowing when we're compiling inside a <code>try</code> block, which requires functions to be called with the LLVM <code>invoke</code> instruction (rather than the usual <code>call</code>) and to specify a basic block to branch to if an exception occurs (i.e. the basic block corresponding to <code>except</code>).</p> <p><code>try</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>finally</code> becomes complex in cases where <code>finally</code> changes control flow in non-trivial ways, such as:</p> <pre><code>def foo():\n    try:\n        return 1\n    finally:\n        return 2\n</code></pre> <p>What does <code>foo()</code> return? If you're not familiar with <code>finally</code> semantics, you might be inclined to say <code>1</code>, but the correct answer is <code>2</code>: <code>finally</code> blocks are always executed.</p> <p>This has important implications for compilation: namely, branches always need to be aware of enclosing <code>try</code>-<code>finally</code> blocks. Here is another example:</p> <pre><code>def bar():\n    for i in range(10):\n        print(i)\n        try:\n            if i == 5:\n                break\n        finally:\n            continue\n</code></pre> <p>When <code>i == 5</code>, we'll reach the <code>break</code> statement, but the <code>break</code> needs to actually branch to the <code>finally</code> block, otherwise the <code>finally</code> block would we skipped over. Now, the <code>finally</code> itself has a <code>continue</code>, which overrides the previous <code>break</code> and resumes the loop. So, in the end, all the integers <code>0</code>...<code>9</code> are printed.</p> <p>To generate correct code for <code>try</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>finally</code>, Codon does the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Firstly, the LLVM lowering pass maintains a stack of enclosing <code>try</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>finally</code> blocks,   since if we reach a <code>return</code>, <code>break</code> or <code>continue</code>, we need to know whether   we really need to branch to some <code>finally</code> block.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, it constructs a state machine for each series of nested <code>try</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>finally</code>   blocks, since once we do reach the <code>finally</code>, we need to know how we got there in order to   determine what action needs to be taken next. For instance, if we got there via a <code>return</code>,   we need to actually execute that return statement at the end of the block; or perhaps we got   there by catching an exception that needs to be delegated to a parent <code>try</code>-<code>except</code>-<code>finally</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The aforementioned state machine has the following states:</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>NORMAL</code>: The <code>finally</code> was reached through normal execution of the code. Nothing special   needs to be done; just branch to the next block normally.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>THROWN</code>: An exception was thrown and we are executing the <code>finally</code> before propagating   the exception out of the function. The exception object itself will be stored in a pre-defined   place that we can access from the <code>finally</code> block.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>CAUGHT</code>: An exception was caught and we are reaching the <code>finally</code> through some <code>except</code> block.   Again nothing special needs to be done here; just branch to the next block normally.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>RETHROW</code>: The <code>finally</code> is being executed while unwinding and the exception must be re-thrown.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>RETURN</code>: The <code>finally</code> was reached after encountering an enclosed <code>return</code> statement. After   executing the <code>finally</code>, we need to execute the <code>return</code>. The return value itself will be   stored in a pre-defined place that we can access from the <code>finally</code> block.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>BREAK</code>: The <code>finally</code> was reached after encountering a <code>break</code>. We need to actually execute   the <code>break</code> after executing the <code>finally</code> block.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>CONTINUE</code>: The <code>finally</code> was reached after encountering a <code>continue</code>. We need to actually   execute the <code>continue</code> after executing the <code>finally</code> block.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Importantly, these actions are recursive, so when we say \"execute the <code>return</code> after executing the <code>finally</code> block\", that may entail branching to another enclosing <code>finally</code> block and repeating the same action.</p> <p>Here is a real example of what this state machine looks like. Consider:</p> <pre><code>def baz():\n    for i in range(5):\n        try:\n            try:\n                if i == 3:\n                    return i\n            finally:\n                if i &gt; 2:\n                    break\n        finally:\n            if i &lt; 4:\n                continue\n    return i\n</code></pre> <p>Here are the various transitions between the states for different conditions throughout the loop:</p> <pre><code>stateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --&gt; NORMAL\n\n    NORMAL --&gt; RETURN: i = 3\n    NORMAL --&gt; BREAK: i &gt; 3\n    NORMAL --&gt; CONTINUE: i \u2264 2\n\n    RETURN --&gt; BREAK: i &gt; 2\n    RETURN --&gt; CONTINUE: i \u2264 2\n    RETURN --&gt; [*]: otherwise\n\n    BREAK --&gt; CONTINUE: i &lt; 4\n    BREAK --&gt; [*]: otherwise\n\n    CONTINUE --&gt; NORMAL</code></pre> <p>The internal state machine will transition between the states based on these conditions until the loop terminates, signified by reaching the end state.</p>"},{"location":"developers/compilation/#variables","title":"Variables","text":"<p>LLVM IR uses static single assignment form, or SSA, which effectively means LLVM IR variables must be assigned exactly once.

Here are some of the important LLVM intrinsics that Codon uses when generating code for coroutines:</p> <ul> <li><code>@llvm.coro.id</code>: Returns a token that can identify the coroutine, which can be passed to many of the   other intrinsics.</li> <li><code>@llvm.coro.size.i64</code>: Returns the size of the coroutine frame for dynamic allocation.</li> <li><code>@llvm.coro.begin</code>: Returns a \"handle\" to the coroutine frame.</li> <li><code>@llvm.coro.suspend</code>: Marks a suspension point.</li> <li><code>@llvm.coro.end</code>: Marks the end of the coroutine and destroys the coroutine frame.</li> <li><code>@llvm.coro.resume</code>: Resumes a coroutine given a coroutine handle.</li> <li><code>@llvm.coro.done</code>: Checks if a coroutine is at its final suspend point.</li> <li><code>@llvm.coro.promise</code>: Returns a pointer to the coroutine promise: a region of memory that stores   values \"yielded\" from the coroutine.</li> <li><code>@llvm.coro.destroy</code>: Destroys a finished coroutine.</li> </ul> <p>With these primitives, generators are implemented roughly as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Functions with <code>yield</code> are converted to LLVM coroutines.</li> <li>Code is generated for <code>yield</code> statements by storing the yielded value in the coroutine promise,   then calling <code>@llvm.coro.suspend</code>.</li> <li>Python's <code>next()</code> built-in is implemented by calling <code>@llvm.coro.done</code> to see if the given generator   is finished, then calling <code>@llvm.coro.resume</code> to resume it and finally <code>@llvm.coro.promise</code> to obtain   the generated value.</li> <li><code>for x in generator</code> is implemented by repeatedly calling <code>@llvm.coro.resume</code>/<code>@llvm.coro.promise</code>   until <code>@llvm.coro.done</code> indicates that we should stop.</li> </ul> <p>Here is an example:</p> <pre><code>for i in range(3):\n    print(i)\n</code></pre> <p>Here is the (simplified) LLVM IR generated for this snippet:</p> <pre><code>entry:\n  %g = call ptr @range(i64 3)\n  br label %for\n\nfor:\n  call void @llvm.coro.resume(ptr %g)\n  %done = call i1 @llvm.coro.done(ptr %g)\n  br i1 %done, label %exit, label %body\n\nbody:\n  %p = call ptr @llvm.coro.promise(ptr %g, i32 8, i1 false)\n  %i = load i64, ptr %p\n  call void @print(i64 %i)\n  br label %for\n\nexit:\n  call void @llvm.coro.destroy(ptr %g)\n</code></pre> <p>In summary:</p> <ul> <li>The call to <code>@range</code> returns a handle (with type <code>ptr</code>) to the range generator.</li> <li>The generator is resumed with <code>@llvm.coro.resume</code> (note that all coroutines will be initially suspended to   match Python's generator semantics).</li> <li>If <code>@llvm.coro.done</code> indicates that the generator is done, the loop is exited and <code>@llvm.coro.destroy</code> is   called to destroy the generator.</li> <li>Otherwise, in the body of the loop, the next value for <code>i</code> is obtained by calling <code>@llvm.coro.promise</code>   (the other arguments are simply the alignment of the promise (<code>i32 8</code>) and whether we want to obtain a   promise given a handle or vice versa (<code>i1 false</code>)).</li> </ul> <p>Coroutines are heavily optimized by LLVM. The code above, after optimizations are applied, becomes simply:</p> <pre><code>  call void @print(i64 0)\n  call void @print(i64 1)\n  call void @print(i64 2)\n</code></pre> <p>Info</p> <p>Codon's LLVM fork implements coroutine elision analysis through escape analysis of the coroutine    handle, as opposed to the standard analysis that relies on examining <code>@llvm.coro.destroy</code> calls.    This was found to be much better at determining which coroutines can be optimized away.</p>"},{"location":"developers/compilation/#program-structure","title":"Program structure","text":"<p>Python doesn't have an explicit <code>main()</code> function as an entry point like C does.

To address this, we want to find patterns of the form <code>d[k] = d.get(k, i) + j</code> and replace them with an implementation that performs just one lookup of <code>k</code>. It turns out that this is nearly impossible to do at the LLVM IR level as <code>dict.__setitem__()</code> (which corresponds to the assignment <code>d[k] = ...</code>) and <code>dict.get()</code> both compile to large, complex LLVM IR that we'd have no hope of recognizing and making sense of after the fact \u2014 in other words, the semantic meaning of the original code (i.e. \"increment the count of <code>k</code> in <code>d</code>\") is effectively lost.</p> <p>To solve this problem, Codon employs its own IR, which sits between the abstract syntax tree and LLVM IR in the compilation process. Codon IR is much simpler than the AST, but still retains enough information to reason about semantics and higher-level constructs. Identifying the dictionary pattern above, for example, amounts to simply identifying a short sequence of IR that resembles <code>dict.__setitem__(d, k, dict.get(d, k, i) + j)</code>.</p>"},{"location":"developers/ir/#at-a-glance","title":"At a glance","text":"<p>Here is a small (simplified) example showcasing CIR in action.

Unlike Python, Codon supports native multithreading, which can lead to speedups many times higher still.

For example, some of Python's modules are not yet implemented within Codon, and a few of Python's dynamic features are disallowed. The Codon compiler produces detailed error messages to help identify and resolve any incompatibilities. Codon supports seamless Python interoperability to handle cases where specific Python libraries or dynamism are required, and also supports writing Python extension modules that can be imported and used from larger Python codebases.</p>"},{"location":"start/faq/#why-codon","title":"Why Codon?","text":"<p>Python is arguably the world's most popular programming language, and is gradually becoming the lingua franca particularly amongst non-technical or non-CS practitioners in numerous fields. It provides a readable, clean syntax, is easy to learn, and has an unmatched ecosystem of libraries. However, Python's achilles heel has always been performance: a typical codebase in pure Python is orders of magnitude slower than its C/C++/Rust counterpart.</p> <p>Codon bridges the gap between Python's simplicity and ease-of-use, and the performance of low-level languages like C++ or Rust, by using novel compiler and type checking techniques to statically compile code ahead-of-time, avoiding all of vanilla Python's runtime overhead and performance drawbacks.</p>"},{"location":"start/faq/#how-does-codon-compare-to","title":"How does Codon compare to...","text":"<ul> <li> <p>CPython? Codon tries to follow CPython's syntax, semantics and APIs as   closely as possible, aside from a few cases where Codon differs from CPython for   performance reasons (one example being Codon's 64-bit <code>int</code> vs. CPython's arbitrary-   width <code>int</code>). Performance-wise, speedups over CPython are usually on the order of 10-100x.</p> </li> <li> <p>Numba? While Codon does offer a JIT decorator similar to Numba's, Codon is in   general an ahead-of-time compiler that compiles end-to-end programs to native code.   It also supports compilation of a much broader set of Python constructs and libraries.</p> </li> <li> <p>PyPy? PyPy strives to effectively be a drop-in replacement for CPython, whereas   Codon differs in a few places in order to eliminate any dynamic runtime or virtual   machine, and thereby attain much better performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cython? Like Cython, Codon has a Python-extension build mode that   compiles to Python extension modules, allowing Codon-compiled code to be imported and called   from plain Python.</p> </li> <li> <p>C++? Codon often generates the same code as an equivalent C or C++ program. Codon   can sometimes generate better code than C/C++ compilers for a variety of reasons, such   as better container implementations, the fact that Codon does not use object files and   inlines all library code, or Codon-specific compiler optimizations that are not performed   with C or C++.</p> </li> <li> <p>Julia? Codon's compilation process is actually much closer to C++ than to Julia. Julia   is a dynamically-typed language that performs type inference as an optimization, whereas   Codon type checks the entire program ahead of time. Codon also tries to circumvent the learning   curve of a new language by adopting Python's syntax and semantics.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mojo? Mojo strives to add low-level programming support/features to the Python language,   while also supporting the rest of Python by relying on CPython. By contrast, Codon aims to   make Python itself more performant by using new type checking and compilation techniques,   without trying to be a superset or drop-in replacement. Codon tries to minimize new syntax   and language features with respect to Python.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can see results from Codon's benchmark suite suite at exaloop.io/#benchmarks.
